        <p>Arnold Schwarzeneggers quotes:</p>
        <ul style="text-align:left;">
          <li>"Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength."</li>
          <li>"Help others and give something back. I guarantee you will discover that while public service improves the lives and the world around you, its greatest reward is the enrichment and new meaning it will bring your own life."</li>
          <li>"I saw a woman wearing a sweatshirt with Guess on it. I said, Thyroid problem?"</li>
          <li>"Failure is not an option. Everyone has to succeed."</li>
          <li>"The resistance that you fight physically in the gym and the resistance that you fight in life can only build a strong character."</li>
          <li>"Government's first duty and highest obligation is public safety."</li>
          <li>"Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength."</li>
          <li>"If it bleeds, we can kill it."</li>
          <li>"The future is green energy, sustainability, renewable energy."</li>
          <li>"It's simple, if it jiggles, it's fat."</li>
          <li>"For me life is continuously being hungry. The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer."</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="text-align:left;">"Arnold woudn't take no for an answer on any level, and he had extreme confidence when asking for something."</h3>
